# cloud-course

Some coursework in cloud systems featuring technologies such as: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud Project, and CI/CD pipelines. Since many of the programs here use GCP, they also require credentials which are stored locally.

The naming convention here is a bit messy because these are personal coursework submissions and no one was breathing down my neck about it.
